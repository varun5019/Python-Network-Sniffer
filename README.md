# Python-Network-Sniffer

This Project is about sniffing the IP header and finding it all theinformation that can be known from it such as Header Length, SubnetMask, Number of Hosts,Number of Valid Host, Number of Networks,Network Id, Default Gateway, Wild- Card address, Broadcast Id, etc.This is a Python Program program that can run on Linux terminal.The user needs to start the script and the sniffer records all the data as mentioned above.

<b>Purpose of the project</b>


Created as a mini-project for Computer Networks Lab 2021 (SRM University - 5th semester).

The purpose of the this project is to develop an easy-to-use Network Sniffer that lets individuals use it to figure out “Is it the
network or a specific application that’s causing slowdowns for users?”. 

<b>Description</b>


A network sniffer “sniffs” or monitors network traffic for information (e.g., where it’s coming from, which device, the protocol used, etc.). Network administrators can use this information to help optimize their environment. Networks function as a collection of “nodes,” such as your smartphone, laptop, server, etc., which transfer information over a networked connection. To speed these transfers along their route, networks use packets of data—chunks of data that are broken down and then reassembled after transmission is complete—to help avoid network congestion.The IP header contains all important information on all packets present in a network. We aim to track down the packets and use their IP headers to display information like version, destination ip, MAC ; source IP and MAC addresses, the data, TCP segement etc.
